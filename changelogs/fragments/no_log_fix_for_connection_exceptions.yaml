bugfixes:
- '**Security Fix** - Some connection exceptions would cause no_log specified on
  a task to be ignored.  If this happened, the task information, including any
  private information could have been displayed to stdout and (if enabled, not
  the default) logged to a log file specified in ansible.cfg''s log_path.
  Additionally, sites which redirected stdout from ansible runs to a log file
  may have stored that private information onto disk that way as well.
