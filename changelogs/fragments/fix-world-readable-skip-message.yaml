- The fix for `CVE-2018-10875 <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-10875>`_
  prints out a warning message about skipping a config file from a world
  writable current working directory.  However, if the user explicitly
  specifies that the config file should be used via the ANSIBLE_CONFIG
  environment variable then Ansible would honor that but still print out the
  warning message.  This has been fixed so that Ansible honors the user's
  explicit wishes and does not print a warning message in that circumstance.
