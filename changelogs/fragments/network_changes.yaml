    Ansible Network improvements

    * Created new connection plugins ``network_cli`` and ``netconf`` to replace ``connection=local``. ``connection=local`` will continue to work for a number of Ansible releases.
    * No more ``unable to open shell``. A clear and descriptive message will be displayed in normal ansible-playbook output without needing to enable debug mode
    * Loads of documentation, see `Ansible for Network Automation Documentation <http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.5/network/>`_.
    * Refactor common network shared code into package under ``module_utils/network/``
    * Filters: Add a filter to convert XML response from a network device to JSON object.
    * Loads of bug fixes.
    * Plus lots more.
